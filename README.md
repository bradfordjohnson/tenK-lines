# TenK-lines

Welcome to TenK-Lines, a personal project where I aim to write 10,000 lines of code in various programming languages. The goal of this project is to improve my coding skills, practice, and learn new languages and concepts.

## Motivation

The idea behind TenK-Lines is simple: practice makes perfect. By committing to write 10,000 lines of code, I am ensuring that I get plenty of practice. This project allows me to explore different programming languages, learn their syntax, and understand their unique features and paradigms.

## Languages

This project will cover a variety of programming languages. Some of these include but are not limited to:

- Python
- JavaScript
- R
- SQL

## Structure

Each language will have its own directory in the repository. Inside each directory, you will find various files that contain code written in that language.
